# Run this file to see the ORM in action
# It's best to run it once and read the output
# Then, go through it section by section to learn the basics

# NOTE: This demo only covers basic read operations, but you can check the rest of C_UD in the code.

# UPDATE: Now, you're down to just _ _ U _ because I added Create and Delete to this tutorial as well. Not the fancy versions, but just the basics for now.

# ANOTHER UPDATE: We are down to _ _ _ _ yay!!! All basic CRUD completed. (But bulk operations and things like that may or may not work. haha)
